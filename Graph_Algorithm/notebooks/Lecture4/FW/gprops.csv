long-description:  The is the directed network of a small subset of posts to other user's wall on Facebook.  The nodes of the network are Facebook users, and each directed edge represents one post, linking the users writing a post to the users whose wall the post is written on.  Since users may write multiple posts on a wall, the network allows multiple edges connecting a single node pair.  Since users may write on their own wall, the network contains loops.

===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the facebook-wosn-wall network: The is the directed network of a small subset of posts to other user's wall on Facebook.  The nodes of the network are Facebook users, and each directed edge represents one post, linking the users writing a post to the users whose wall the post is written on.  Since users may write multiple posts on a wall, the network allows multiple edges connecting a single node pair.  Since users may write on their own wall, the network contains loops.


More information about the network is provided here:

Files: 
    meta.facebook-wosn-wall -- Metadata about the network 
    out.facebook-wosn-wall -- The adjacency matrix of the network in whitespace-separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.facebook-wosn-wall are: 
        First column: ID of from node 
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column (if present): weight or multiplicity of edge
        Fourth column (if present):  timestamp of edges Unix time
        Third column: edge weight
        Fourth column: timestamp of the edge
